              <p class="read-more-wrap">
                The art of a person's schedule. The well known calendar invite. Some (let's refer to this group as "Managers") live by this tool 
                and cannot function properly without checking it every morning to plan the upcoming day. However, for others (let's refer to these 
                people as "Makers") see this tool as more of a creative killer, a buzzkill, a wet blanket (I think you get my point) that just becomes 
                a part of life that you learn to live with because society deems it "normal".<span class="read-more-target">
                Growing up in a very "Always show up 5 minutes early" type environment, it was definitely instilled in me at a very young age that 
                it is rude to show up late for an appointment/meeting/commitment. Humans as a whole, respect the value of time and do our best to manage it,
                control it, and try to optimize it throughout our lives. The issue that I have run into with this type of mindset is that creation/creativity 
                does not live on a timed schedule. Now, of course there are ways to set aside time for creative thoughts and process; however, when you get "real"
                with yourself, sometimes creativity just strikes during your morning shower, or in the middle of a meeting, or maybe right before you fall asleep. My inital 
                instinct when this little beam of brilliance hits me is to write it down, sketch it up, or code that motha until the cows come home. Unfortunately,
                herein lies the issue ... I cannot just get up and leave a meeting to go indulge on a little creative snack. I find if my entire day is following a 
                "Managers" schedule that very little creative work gets done that day. Usually what occurs is a lot of planning, and discussing, and perhaps some problem 
                generation gets done, but usually very little out of the box thinking occurs. On the flip side, if I block out maybe the first four hours of my morning, 
                just to hold from being scooped up by the meeting troll ... then more times than not, something cool and new is generated or brought into existence to play a role (maybe) 
                in this wonderful world called Design.</span>

                  Giving in Marriage: Who presents this beautiful woman to be married? Gathering Words: On behalf of
                  Janel and Rob I welcome you all here today and thank you for bearing witness to such a sacred moment in their lives. {Pause}
                  Janel and Rob have chosen each and every one of us to be here with them today to witness their Wedding Vows as they join
                  together as husband and wife.<span class="read-more-target">    
                  Marriage is more than just the union of two people; it is the gathering of a community as evidence
                  by your presence here. As witnesses to this union you are charged with a very special responsibility, to support and encourage
                  this couple throughout their years to come. And so, there will be a point in this ceremony where you too {look at crowd}
                  will be asked to join in and share your declaration of support for this couple. Now, each of us knows that a marriage is
                  not created by law or a ceremony; but rather it occurs in the hearts of two people. It grows out of loving, caring, and sharing
                  ourselves with another. So, in witnessing this ceremony today, we are observing only an outward sign of an inward union that
                  already exists between Janel and Rob. Today, they have come before us to publicly affirm their love; to promise to nurture
                  themselves, each other, and this union; and to acknowledge its foundation in their lives. They do so knowing that marriage
                  is at once the most tender, yet challenging, of all relations in life. Opening Blessing Now let us pray, Dear God, We ask
                  for your blessings upon this man and woman, as we celebrate this momentous occasion in their lives. Grant them happiness
                  and contentment as they establish their new home, create a new family and explore the depths of their love for one another.
                  Bless their families and friends and the relationships, which have supported, strengthened and sustained them throughout
                  their lives. Bless their home as a place of love and of peace. And allow their marriage to bring them all the excitements
                  a marriage should bring. Amen. Moment of Silence At this time we’d like to take a moment of silence to remember those who
                  are no longer here with us. These individuals helped make Janel and Rob into the people they are today, and we acknowledge
                  their presence here with us in spirit. Let us now take a moment of silence to honor and hold in our hearts all those who
                  have passed. ( Moment of Silence here) {Count to 10} Please cherish the memories of these friends and family and all others
                  who live on in our hearts. Amen. Honor the Parents Janel and Rob are extremely blessed to have such selfless parents who
                  love them unconditionally. Anna and Andy, David and Vanessa, and Bob and Diane - your love, support and wisdom has developed
                  two amazing young adults, who have brought together so many great people today to witness the start of something special.
                  You should be proud of what you have all done to create such a beautiful moment, knowing that Janel and Rob are extremely
                  grateful for all that you do. It’s on their behalf that I honor you and congratulate you in this moment. Thank you. Charge
                  to Couple Janel and Rob, the commitment of marriage is not meant to be entered into lightly, but with certainty and mutual
                  respect. Your love for one another and your willingness to accept each other’s strengths and weaknesses will help cement
                  the foundation for a strong and lasting marriage. Learn to respect your individual outlooks. Share your thoughts, experiences
                  and dreams with one another. Cherish the intimacy and understanding that comes with the passage of time. And certainly in
                  the nearly three and a half years you have been together you have come to love a lot of things about one another, which is
                  why I asked you to privately share with me a list of 5 things you love about your partner, {look at crowd} what they didn’t
                  know is that I would then be sharing this information with all of you! Rob’s favorite things he loves about Janel: Rob loves
                  … -How patient Janel is in all walks of life -He loves Her intelligence and focus -He loves her sense of humor and joy -Rob
                  loves how beautiful Janel is inside and out -And finally, Rob loves Janel’s loving heart and caring nature Janel’s favorite
                  things about Rob: Janel loves that ... -Rob instills confidence in her and always sees the best in life -She loves that he
                  is strong mentally and physically and that he never falters, and never lets anything break him -Janel loves that she never
                  gets bored or has a bad time when she is with Rob -She loves that you can make her laugh until she cries -And finally Janel
                  loves that you and her will always have one another to grow old with together. Remember that in life the little things ARE
                  the big things. Remember that love is about saying “I love you” not only when you want to say it, but when your partner needs
                  to hear it. It’s about not going to bed angry and never taking the other for granted. It’s continuing the courtship through
                  years to come. It’s sharing the same values and standing together to face the world. It’s about doing things for each other,
                  not in the attitude of duty or sacrifice, but in the spirit of love & giving. Appreciate each other and show your gratitude
                  often and in thoughtful ways. Remember that marriage isn’t just about finding the right partner; it’s about being the right
                  partner. Janel and Rob today there is a vast unknown future before you. That future, with its joys and sorrows, is hidden
                  from your eyes. But it is a great tribute to your faith in each other that you are willing to face these uncertainties together.
                  May the love you share grow deeper and more secure with every passing year. Reading by I would now like to invite Shane Mahoney
                  up to pray over this couple on this very special day. Vows And now it is time to share in the vows of marriage: Rob, please
                  answer me this: Do you Robert, take thee Janel, to be your lawfully wedded wife? From this day forward, to have and to hold,
                  for better, for worse, for richer and for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, all the days of your
                  life? I DO. Janel, please answer me this: Do you Janel, take thee Robert, to be your lawfully wedded husband? From this day
                  forward, to have and to hold, for better, for worse, for richer and for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to
                  cherish, all the days of your life? I DO. Rings (provided by James Marasti) May we have the rings please? From the earliest
                  times, the circle has been a symbol of completeness, a sign of abiding love. An unbroken circle that represents a commitment
                  of love that is never ending. These rings symbolize the ties that bind you together as husband and wife. As often as either
                  of you looks at these rings, I hope that you will be reminded of the enduring covenant to love each other which you have
                  made today. Rob, as you place the ring on Janel’s finger please repeat after me: I Robert || give to you Janel || this ring
                  || as a sign of my vow || to love, honor and cherish you || forever and ever. Janel, as you place the ring on Robert’s finger
                  please repeat after me: I Janel || give to you Robert || this ring || as a sign of my vow || to love, honor and cherish you
                  || forever and ever. Declaration of Support from Guests As I told you earlier, you have a special responsibility as witnesses
                  to this gathering. Rob and Janel chose to have an intimate gathering of family and friends for this wonderful occasion so
                  they could honor each of you and let you know how deeply in their hearts they care for you and how deeply honored they are
                  to have family and friends who love them the way that you do. They wanted to feel the presence and love of family and friends
                  as they make this lifelong commitment to one another. So, I now invite each of you as members of this gathering to verbally
                  share your support for Janel and Rob by answering “we will” to the following question: Will each of you, do everything you
                  can to love, support, and care for these two people in their marriage? Guests: We will. I encourage you to always choose
                  love in your thoughts about and interactions with Janel and Rob. Stand beside them, not between them. Come to them with hearts
                  of peace, not judgment. Honor their marriage. Show them your kindness, your support, and your loving hearts. On their behalf,
                  I thank you. Call to Presence Now, before I pronounce you two as a married couple, I have just one more thing I want you
                  to do. Your wedding day is one that seems to fly. It’s a day filled with emotion, rings, food, and friends. Many people remember
                  how fleeting their own wedding day was. So I want you to take a few seconds to look into each other’s eyes. {pause for effect}
                  Think about the happiness that you’re feeling in this place, in this moment. Really let that feeling register in your heart
                  and your mind. Now, I want you to think about your life together in twenty years. Where are you? What are you doing? We all
                  know that your visions of the future are not identical, but always complimentary, the great John Lennon once said, “a dream
                  you dream alone is only a dream, but a dream you dream together, now THAT is reality.” I pray for you both, that new reality
                  starts now. Pronouncement: Janel and Rob, having witnessed your vows of love and faith to one another, by the power vested
                  in me, it is my joy and personal privilege to pronounce you husband and wife, and you may now kiss the bride. Ladies and
                  Gentleman it is my pleasure to introduce for the first time anywhere, Mr. and Mrs. Robert and Janel Marasti! Please show
                  them some love and shower them with pedals.</span>

                  Greetings from Whittier, AK! This is James currently on the keys, about to dive into some incredible memories from yesterday’s
                  unbelievable trip to the “Little Fishing Town Beneath the Ice”.<span class="read-more-target"> 
                  Maegan and I set off for this adventure at 4:30a in the morning
                  (I would usually say in the early dark parts of the morning, but it is currently sunny basically all day, so actually we
                  had our shades on and sunblock ready to go). Our 3 hour drive was nothing less than incredible as we dipped, dove, climbed
                  and crawled around mountains and valleys through the back roads of this beautiful place called the “Last Frontier”. Arriving
                  a bit early for our 26 Glacier Cruise, Maegan and I decided to get lost in the town a bit and figure out where we would be
                  staying that night. Immediately after walking down the road a few blocks, you could tell that we were no longer in Kansas
                  (so to speak). This was a very old fishing town, that had seen the hardship of several cold/brutal winters over the years.
                  I instantly fell in love with the multitude of creative ideas that started rushing through my mind. How gnarly it would
                  be to spend a month or two here, just writing and drinking … coffee (wink) as life goes on back in the lower 48. Maegan could
                  perform therapy on all the sailors and fisherman, and I could write and fish … what more do you need! After a few hours,
                  we had located a hostel for us to crash in that night, filled our bellies with some delicious reindeer breakfast sandwiches,
                  and were ready for the cruise of a lifetime. Captain Speedy, tore out of the harbor on a mission. We were going to be on
                  a tight deadline to literally see 26 glaciers in less than 5 hours. I will give him some props though, we hit them all and
                  saw some unbelievable wildlife along the way. Maegan was able to capture some unreal snaps of a beautiful humpback whale,
                  sea lion, otters, tons of glaciers, a few waterfalls, and her “Ballin Little Bro” diving into the ocean (blink). Capt Speedster
                  brought us back to the harbor right on time like a pro. No words (although I always try) could really do justice to what
                  we just experienced. The Dougherty Duo will be setting off for Anchorage today as we putz around Whitter for a few more hours
                  looking for new adventures. You never know what He may bring as I sit gazing out my hostel window overlooking the Pacific
                  Ocean, a magnificent little hummingbird has been buzzing around me as a blessing from my late great mother no doubt. Life
                  is something special, my friends. Nothing more to do, but enjoy the ride.</span>

                Day 6: Until Next Time. The end has finally arrived, unfortunately. Day 6 was by far the hardest emotionally just knowing
                that we would be traveling to the airport the next morning, rather than back on the bus to continue our service journey.
                It was such a great day though as a whole from beginning to end.<span class="read-more-target"> 
                Our teams were finally in the same areas working together as one unit. Medical saw over 600 patients this week which is 
                really incredible for a team smaller than 10. This morning
                we finished the mission at a girls orphanage to make sure they all had physicals from the medical staff and had prayer
                for anything going on in their lives. I had the honor of praying over eight girls with the Medical Minister. His words
                and passion for the Lord is unlike any other. I can see his light shining through as soon as he walks in a door. I pray
                that he will continue to serve and pray for others even after returning to Pittsburgh. Later in the morning we decided
                to play kickball, basketball, futbol, and dance (they loved the cupid shuffle). There was no lesson or plan we just wanted
                to laugh and play like kids are supposed to do at that age. There was no fighting, no arguing, just good old fashion fun.
                Reflecting back on these past 6 days kept reminding me that none of this would have been possible without Head Honcho and
                Seis. Of course someone else could have led this trip and I’m sure it would have went just fine, but this was not a “fine”
                trip. This was a trip for the ages that has sparked a fire in the Crochet Queen and me to continue on these acts of services
                for many years to come. Head Honcho and Seis did an unbelievable job leading our Missions team and I would like to thank
                them publically for all that God has done in their lives and pray that he will continue to work wonders for these two.
                Our night ended with a farewell dinner for our team, our coordinators, the security, our amazing translators, and our awesome
                driver/guide. Everyone looked great all cleaned up, ready for a good meal and even better conversation. I wanted the night
                to continue for hours, since I knew the time for goodbyes had arrived. I have never been a fan of goodbyes, I try to avoid
                them by sneaking out of parties early, sending texts rather than meeting in person, or just ignoring them altogether; however,
                these were inevitable. I will pray for out extended team, and hope to see many of them again some day. A verse from one
                of the songs we sang during our nighttime devotionals is, “Your love is deeper than my view of grace, higher than this
                worldly place, longer than this road I’ve traveled, wider than the gap you’ve filled.” We never know what God has in store
                for us next, whether it be a missions trip, a new calling, an old friendship coming back to life, we cannot predict the
                future. All we can do in this life is to love on those who stroll into our road traveled, and have faith that good will
                always overcome evil.</span>

                 Day 5: A Day I Will Never Forget. Today was the Missions Team’s last day at the Family Hope Center and the Sinai School.
                  Our morning kicked off with an extremely powerful prayer session with all the mothers broken into smaller groups to share
                  with our team what was on their hearts.<span class="read-more-target"> 
                  You could literally feel the positivity working around our circles within the Spanish and English prayers. 
                  The Holy Spirit was undeniable this morning! It just baffles me how strong these women are who are single parents, raising their young
                  ones, with very low opportunity for employment; however, the majority of their prayers were for others. You never heard
                  them ask for more money or a nicer home, instead they asked for blessings over their children and parents, better opportunities
                  for their sisters and brothers, and prayers for the government to help steer this country back in the right direction.
                  Our team decided to end our time with them learning how to make headbands out of cut up shirts. The women mastered this
                  technique instantly and began using the materials to improvise our lesson plan. They began braiding beautiful patterns
                  making headbands, bracelets, and belts to give as gifts or wear around town. We ended our time together singing a song
                  in Spanish led by one woman who in my opinion would make it onto The Voice hands down. Although we could not understand
                  the lyrics, we could feel the meaning and joy from the ladies clapping and smiling. I woke up knowing that we would be
                  saying goodbye to the little ones later in the day, but was not expecting how attached I had gotten to a few that reminded
                  me of myself at a young age. When you Google San Pedro Sula, your initial thoughts are the crime, gangs, poverty, corruption,
                  but these children are truly no different than you and I at their core. They have the basic human needs, they love sports,
                  puzzles, coloring, singing, dancing, jump roping, making arts and crafts, and piggy back rides (at one point I think the
                  kids thought that Head Honcho and I were their personal horses, yelling VAMOS as we ran by one another tired, but happy
                  to be exactly where we were). The afternoon went extremely smooth even with the downpour causing us to change up the game
                  plan. Sadly, our time with these kids had come to an end. After several high-fives and hugs, our new amigos were out the
                  door and back to life as they knew it. I pray that our time together will be remembered when tough roads present themselves
                  to these young souls. I pray that they will always remember that Jesus es Super Fuerte, and that He will never leave their
                  sides in times of need. I will never forget this community for the rest of my days. I will pray for them always.</span>

              <p class="read-more-wrap">
                Day 4: Today the Son was shining bright! This morning we sent our medical team to the clinic, which I will discuss in much
                further detail later. However, now we were off to the family hope center to recap day two with the Crochet Queen and the
                mother’s of Las Brisas. Today’s topic was more private, thus, the men were not invited.<span class="read-more-target"> 
                Instead we enjoyed legos in a side
                room with the women’s children and I will tap out on this blog, if you will, while CQ updates you on the morning with the
                women. Hola!!! Today was another perfect day. The women were so open and so perceptive to the discussion. I will respect
                their confidentiality and keep the meat of our discussion private. I had special help from Seis, the Traveling Heart, and
                Wise Scholar as well as a team of translators. One thing I found striking was the similarities between the culture in Honduras
                and in the States. The topic was a very broad understanding of health, human growth and development, and ways to protect
                ourselves. Common issues the women discussed, our ministry team agreed were similar issues we notice in our own interpersonal
                circles. After the discussion, we moved on to arts and crafts! I was not born a Queen of Crocheting. My Grandmother spent
                many years teaching me. Today, I got to give back and share this trade with 40 plus women. Nicole and Carol helped translate
                what I was doing step by step and the women picked it up faster than anyone I had ever seen! I also got to educate my
                own team members which was such an awesome bonding experience. Seis and Wise Scholar will be making scarves and blankets
                for the holidays, take your orders now! The morning flew right before my eyes. I cannot wait to continue the lesson tomorrow.
                The Traveling Heart also led a craft, one that we all got instant gratification from: awesome headbands made from tying
                t-shirts together. Seriously, check them out, they’re sweet! She mastered these in less than 10 minutes. Tomorrow, we will
                also spend time showing the women this trade. Headbands are a popular accessory in San Pedro Sula, as the weather is hot.
                I’ve sweat in places I didn’t even know existed, TMI? So having a band to collect the sweat is very useful. Our hope is
                the women can reproduce headbands on their own and make an income from selling them in their community. CQ out! Our ministry
                team headed back to regroup at the clinic with the medical team to enjoy lunch together and hear about one another’s day,
                I had the chance to catch up with Big Cheese and his team of talented medical professionals. To my surprise this day was
                a bit different then the previous two. Our team did not see many walking well during their hours unfortunately. One adult
                woman who weighed around 75 pounds was having a serious issue with having her body basically eat itself from trying to
                breastfeed her new born child. The saddest part is that she is just trying to provide nutrients for her niño; however,
                the effect is that it is actually damaging her physically. Another patient was a young man (younger than me) who had a
                scar from his left shoulder, a crossed his throat, up his head from a machete battle. Apparently it is the norm for boys
                to have a machete by the age of 12 or 13. If that alone does not make your jaw drop, the amount of machete fights that
                occur in Honduras might make that jaw hit the floor. A patient that I actually got the chance to see at the clinic was
                an elderly woman that had wounds all over her feet. Big Cheese later told me that her feet were basically destroying themselves
                from the severe case of untreated diabetes. In the states this women would have been hospitalized for at least two weeks,
                no questions asked. However, since Honduras is not fortunate enough to have these resources, her wounds were cleaned and
                bandages and she was on her way after about 20 minutes. I ask all you readers out there to continue praying not only for
                our incredible teams and the work that we are doing down here, but for all the patients and children that will not be leaving
                to return to a country where there is an Urgent Care on every corner and a bathroom that has working plumbing.</span>

                Day 3: Jesus es Super Fuerte. “All I need is you Lord is you Lord. Lord all I need is You!” As I sit listening to these lyrics
                from Hillsong, reflecting on the last thirteen hours of day tres, I cannot stop thinking about how blessed I am to have
                been a part of this trip/this group. Our team is led by unbelievable, strong, wise, LOVING individuals that when put together
                in SPS move mountains to make a difference.<span class="read-more-target"> 
                Our day began meeting with a large group of single mothers whose children have
                been in our prayers for sometime now. The women met us at the Hope Center where you could tell as they walked in the door,
                they did not know what to expect over the next three-hour session. To say these women have had a hard life would be like
                saying that Pittsburgh only kind of likes the Steelers (understatements of the century). I had been praying about what
                was about to occur next the majority of the previous night, as well as, the morning during our small group devotional.
                My wife, let’s refer to her as The Crochet Queen in this blog, has a background in mental health counseling. Her goal during
                today’s session was to not only educate these wonderful mothers about wellness and how we can practice a healthier lifestyle,
                but to also listen to actual concerns and issues that these ladies were currently going through in their everyday lives.
                Watching my wife in her element is something that every husband should have the privilege of doing numerous times throughout
                a marriage. Women who were reluctant at first to open up, started sharing stresses in their lives about relationships,
                worries, pains that caused them unwanted and really speaking honestly unneeded anxiety in their lives. Our ministry team
                worked with these mothers to teach them coping mechanisms (meditation & stress ball creation) to help relieve the stress
                in a healthy way, which can be preformed no matter where they are or what time of the day. Meditation seemed to be a huge
                hit with not only the mothers, but also our ministry team. Who knew that something so easy as closing your eyes and picturing
                a series of images could release so much tension. The stress balls were more of a Do It Youself tutorial, where our team
                took balloons and filled them with flour to form a pretty legitimate stress reliever. However, never having actually practiced
                this prior to the demonstration the students quickly became the teachers, showing us a thing or two about how to handle
                flour without dumping the majority on the pavement. The session concluded with prayer requests and hands being layed on
                those in need. The power of prayer never seizes to amaze me, even with the language barrier your heart is filled with such
                a passion for these people in this community just trying to protect and give their children a life that is safe and fruitful.
                The second part of our day was focused around Vacation Bible School or VBS. Children poured into the Clinic’s courtyard
                bull rushing me like I was the last Power Chicken in all of SPS. Quickly before I knew it, I had one minion climbing on
                my back, two bigger minions hanging from my arms, and a new pair of shoes that weighed about fifty pounds each. These kids
                had the ability to put a smile on your face no matter what any of us had going on back in the states. One of our leaders,
                let’s call her Seis, started playing music that caught all the kids attention immediately. The name of the song was Super
                Fuerte, which in English translates to Super Strong. Children were jumping up and down, clapping their hands, playing air
                guitar, and some even rushed the stage, probably to try and get Seis’s autograph. The Lord was truly working wonders yesterday
                during VBS, our medical team said that you could feel the energy throughout the entire clinic. We finished the day off
                by teaching the children a lesson about conviction. The kids then had the option to make arts and crafts, color, create
                puzzles, play futbol in the courtyard, or build with legos. Out of those options the coloring room was the stations with
                the most chaos. Who knew that Honduran children loved coloring books more than futbol?! Our drive back to the hotel was
                very different then previous days. Our clothes were dirty, our body’s were exhausted, but our smiles and stories from the
                day were all that we focused on.</span>

                Day 2: The Gifts That Keep On Giving. Greetings blog followers! Day 2 in SPS was a powerful day to say the least. Our North
                Way crew started our morning off picking up 7 incredible/essential translators to help with the language barrier that we
                face this week. Our bus of 20+ members made our way to a popular Honduran clinic where we dropped off supplies for our
                amazing medical team to prep for the 120 patients they were about to see. Our medical leader, Big Cheese, said that even
                on a busy day 120 is more than twice the amount of patients he would ever see in one day back in the states with our size
                medical group.<span class="read-more-target"> 
                While the medical team was laying healing hands on those in need, the ministry team was off at Iglesia del
                Nazareno sitting patiently in an empty church eagerly awaiting our first Honduran church service to begin. The sign directly
                behind the stage read, “Hacer Discipulos Semejantes a Cristo en las Naciones”, which in English loosely translates to Go
                therefore and make disciples of all nations. As I sat and thought about what making disciples really means to me as a Christian,
                my thought process was broken by a whirlwind of little feet stampeding towards the big empty room where we all sat. Thinking
                back on the moment now, the best way to describe it would be a blur of Honduran children rushing towards us with ear-to-ear
                smiles. To call these kids shy could not be farther from the truth. After settling, we began passing the peace, as we would
                say in America. However, in Honduras the peace is literally passed to everyone in the room. Almost like a small party that
                happens pre-sermon. It was such a welcoming and wonderful feeling to have the majority of the church come and greet you
                just for being a part of their community on such a special Sunday. Pastor Victor gave an incredible sermon that was translated
                by our wonderful new friend, Carol. We learned about the human nature of always asking for things from God without always
                obeying Him in how we live our lives. If we ask our Father for things that are set on our hearts, we need to be prepared
                to follow in Christ’s footsteps as He has asked for all of His children. The service was completed by several worship songs
                and then a very powerful praying session all done in Spanish. Although I really could not understand the majority of either,
                I could feel the Spirit working throughout the entire room in one way or another. Our team was truly blessed to witness
                such a beautiful event. As we made our way to the Buckner Center, many of us were not expecting what was about to occur
                next. Our team began setting up shoes that had been donated to Buckner for this trip. About 50 shoes of various sizes and
                colors were now organized to be distributed to all those in need. A row of chairs were lined up for our soon to be happy
                customers. One by one a child entered with old dirty shoes, sat on the chair (little legs not long enough to touch the
                ground), and immediately a smile appeared as a new pair of shoes were brought over. Our team took pride in taking off the
                old pair, washing away the dirt with a fresh pair of socks, and fitting a brand new pair of sneakers onto a foot that
                had new roads and paths just waiting to be discovered in their young little lives. Forty-six shoes were given away by the
                end of the afternoon, and four were being switched out for a different size that will be given away tomorrow. I have bought
                a lot of sneakers in my day; however, not a single pair had made me as happy as giving a pair to children in need today.
                On our way back to the hotel, we needed to make a few pit stops to stock up on some additional supplies. As the majority
                of the team waited in the bus, our driver and coffee connoisseur began giving us a bit of a history lesson on Honduras
                to pass the time. One question led to another, and before we knew it somewhere between coffee being made from milk and
                espresso beans dipped in cinnamon sugar, he opened up about being a single father raising a 16-year-old son and 14-year-old
                daughter while working full-time to provide for his family. My heart felt for this strong Christian man who had been through
                so much in his life, but still shined the light of Christ on all those around him. Please continue to keep this team and
                all those we have encountered/will be encountering this week in your prayers. Each day continues to bring us closer to
                our Lord and one another as we serve.</span>

                Travel Day: Making Our Way to San Pedro Sula. Hola! I am currently writing my first entry from San Pedro Sula, Honduras.
                Spoiler alert: we made it all in one piece (friends and families please rest easy tonight). Our first day began meeting
                in the PIT airport at 4:30a EST.<span class="read-more-target"> 
                Most of us running on only a few hours of sleep and a few more cups of coffee in our systems,
                our incredible party of 13 began our journey to help others, as well, as ourselves in our search for something more. Whether
                that search be for medicine/medical attention, love, hope, or possibly to learn a skill that could help produce a beneficial
                outcome for their household, our team has prayed that whatever reason brings these children of God into our lives this
                week that we can portray Christ through all that we do. The trip to Honduras was very entertaining to say the least. If
                you had asked me at 3am EST this morning if I would stay up the majority of the flight, I would have said “No bueno, mi
                amigo!” Little did I know that our youngest (and most energetic) member of our crew would be my traveling buddy during
                day 1. In this blog, we shall refer to her as Little Foot aka Big Cheese’s daughter. We had a great time traveling to Atlanta
                for our layover, making up stories to pass the time as we made our way San Pedro Sula. Little Foot is a returning member
                for this particular Missions Trip and kept talking about seeing her friend from last year, Luis. Luis has come up in conversation
                several times in the past few months while prepping for this journey. He is basically our “go-to” guy for all things Honduran.
                The man definitely lives up to all the hype. He met us in the airport, shortly after arriving, and gained my trust immediately
                when one of our bags was flagged for something “suspicious”. My guess was all the balloons and/or crafts for our Bible
                Study activities with the kids this week. Nevertheless, Luis was on top of this from square one and everything was handled
                and back to normal within minutes. Having now reached our destination (trust me the 100% humidity is hard to miss walking
                out of the airport doors) my eyes were immediately open to the culture change when we had to keep a watch on our bags until
                they made their way from our hands to a helper who would then place them into our van. This was to avoid any runaway luggage
                that would never return. Our agenda for the rest of Day 1 was to go over a few basic rules that were non-negotiable for
                the week, grab some food from my now favorite fast food restaurant of all time (Power Chicken!!), attend our first Church
                service of the trip, and finish the night off with a team dinner and breakdown. Unfortunately the Church service was cancelled
                due to flooding from all the rain that had occurred during the day. Hopefully this will not hinder our plans for the upcoming
                week since the forecast for the next several days is rain, rain, and more rain. All in all though Day 1 was a great success,
                bringing our team closer together as a whole and closer to God as followers. We thank Him for this wonderful opportunity,
                and are so blessed to be able to spend this next week putting Him above all.</span>

                Packing Day! This morning the 2015 fall Honduras Team met one last time to pack all the supplies for next week’s trip.
                It is hard to believe we are only one week away from a trip we have all been preparing for the last few months. This morning
                we each brought a suitcase to fill full of supplies.<span class="read-more-target"> 
                In each suitcase we packed donated medicine, donated clothes, hygiene
                products, dictionaries, calculators, donated medicine, school supplies, bible study supplies, arts and crafts, toys, and
                more donated medicine. Did I mention the donated medicine?! Our group is beyond thankful for all the donations and prayers
                we have received in preparation for this trip. From clothes to medicine to helping fund each and every one of our trips;
                our gratitude is immeasurable. Please continue to keep us in your thoughts and prayers as we continue to prepare physically,
                emotionally and spiritually. So what is next? We will meet at the airport October 17th at 4:30 in the morning to begin
                our adventure to San Pedro Sula. We will be there for a full week helping any way we can (don’t worry we will update this
                blog at least once maybe twice a day to fill you in on all of our many adventures!) We are all experiencing many emotions
                but the main theme is excitement. We have been well prepared by our leaders and are ready to put our hands to work.</span>

                  The realization that I have mild OCD has become very apparent to me these past 6 months.<span class="read-more-target"> 
                  Maegan points it out sometimes, but
                  I have always known that it twas there. I have this weird thing about keeping my electronics clean. I know that
                  the reasoning behind this is that electronics fascinate me to the highest degree. There is just something about a clean screen
                  on a brand new piece of hardware that has the latest and fastest software uploaded on it that makes me light up. The
                  issue with this is that everything gets dim, dusty, and smudged after time and use. I am consciously trying to change my
                  weird ways of keeping my laptop screen clean. The whole point of these awesome inventions is to serve us, not the other way
                  around. I will keep my readers (1) posted on this issue, but rest easy people (1) I do not lose sleep over this weird little
                  quirk of mine. “All things new and clean, have no story nor past within their journey” — Yours truly</span>
