        <h2>The Experience</h2>
          <p>Hood to Coast – DICK’S Sporting Goods Corporate Team  
            Looney Leg, Chunk Leg or the Cuckoo Leg? Don’t worry, i’ll explain!  
             
            DICK’S Sporting Goods is a Gold Level Sponsor of Hood to Coast Relay – the mother of all relay races. It’s a 192-mile relay that starts atop  
            Mt. Hood and finishes in Seaside, OR. Along the way you’ll run at dawn and at dusk, in the mist and on the gravel and you may even have  
            your own sasquatch sighting (we’re serious, it can happen this year). As a sponsor DSG has three teams for a total of 36 runners and 6  
            drivers. Here are the ins and outs of what it takes to be a DSG corp team member:</p>
          <h6>All DSG Corporate team runners must:</h6>
            <ol>
              <li>Be OK with getting to know your co-workers on a different level. It’s one thing to see a co-worker on the treadmill next to you at the  
                gym, another to sleep on their shoulder as you just ran 10 miles without a change of clothes or a shower.</li>
              <li>Have a sense of humor as the lack of sleep combine with runs makes for some great (possibly non-work appropriate stories).</li>
              <li>Have some time and money to make the trip (we’ll cover this in more detail)</li>
              <li>Be fun!</li>
            </ol>
        <h4 class="takeaway">My Role</h4>
            <p>As a Corporate DSG member of "Team Yeti", my role was a bit complex. I not only would be participating as a runner, acting as a travel guide, 
              representing my company as a main sponsor for the event, but also decided that this would be the perfect opportunity to peak inside the inner workings of an 
              event that not many are fortunate (or maybe crazy) enough to attend. Before participating at Hood to Coast, I had no idea how locked down this wonderful/insane 3
              day relay was for racers.

          <h4 class="takeaway">The Scoop</h4>
          <h6>GREEN LACES || All weekend</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>DICK'S Sporting Goods was and still is committed to help #saveyouthsports. Join us in our quest to get green laces on sneakers across the country by swapping out
                your laces. Green laces are available for purchase at any DICK's Sporting Goods store. If we were spotted along the course wearing a pair, THE Sasquatch
                or a DSG brand ambassador would have an instant prize for us.
              </li>
            </ul>

                the course from the Starting Line to Exchange 6.
              </li>
              <li>Trigger Point's Master Trainer was onsite to demonstrate foam rolling techniques. VERY COOL and super helpful!</li>

            <ul>
              <li>DSG set up 400 camping tents and a VIP camping area for racers to rest ... for some reason I decided to fall asleep in a van chair. Not my best decision.
              </li>
              <li>Scorecard Members would show their rewards card at the check-in and received a branded "Sleeping Better Bag" containing an eye mask and ear plugs.</li>
            </ul>
          <h6>FINISH LINE || Saturday, August 26th, 8:30AM - 6:00PM</h6>
            <ul>

          <h6>DSG VIP TEAM SUITE (FINISH LINE) || Saturday, August 26th, 8:30AM - 6:00PM</h6>

                dedicated mixologist.
              </li>
              <li>A recovery area with massage tables and two massage therapists was also available and greatly taken advantage of following the finish.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>THE Sasquatch with branded DSG apparel also made an appearance at various exchange points and locations throughout the course. Sasquatch would carry a backpack
